I am studying the neural mechanisms of memory formation by analyzing electrophysiological signals during both sleep and wakefulness across different species and developmental stages, using oscillatory and information-theoretical methods.

**Current Affiliation**: I am a postdoc at the [Helfrich Lab](https://helfrich-lab.com/) located at the [Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research](https://www.hih-tuebingen.de/en).
